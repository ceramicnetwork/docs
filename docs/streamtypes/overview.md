# StreamTypes

Each Stream in Ceramic is of a specific type. Different StreamTypes can contain different structures of data, and have different APIs for creating, updating, and inspecting them. The currently available StreamTypes are:

* [TileDocument](tile-document/overview.md) - A JSON Document store for arbitrary application data.
* [Caip10Link](caip-10-link/overview.md) - A blockchain account link for publicly linking  blockchain addresses to DIDs.
