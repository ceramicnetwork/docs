# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 20, 2020

This Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”) describes how 3Box Labs, our related products, including but not limited to Ceramic, IDX, and self.ID(“**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”) collects, uses, shares, and stores Personal Information when app developers and other users (“**you**”) use 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, self.ID, and all related tools, applications, websites, data, software, infrastructure, and other services we provide (the “**Products, Services, and Network**”).
By accessing or using the Products, Services, and Network you accept this Policy and our [Terms and Conditions](3boxlabs-terms-conditions.md), and you consent to our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of your Personal Information as described in this Policy. **If you do not agree with any part of this Policy or our Terms and Conditions, you must stop accessing the Products, Services, and Network.** To exercise any rights you may have over your Personal Information, please see the section on Your Choices below.

## DECENTRALIZED DATA STORAGE

Our Products, Services, and Network are blockchain-agnostic and leverage distributed-data-storage systems, so nearly all data is kept directly with you and other users and not on our servers, computers, or other systems and devices. To help you manage your data and content, our Products and Services allow you to create and link an Account or Decentralized ID (“**DID**”). These features are intended to give you more control over your data and privacy-preserving options to choose how your Personal Information is shared and used by other applications or services. For example, to the extent any data is stored privately on the Products and Services, it is unreadable by other apps and users unless you expressly grant others permission to access your data.

**If you shared your data with other users or a third-party app hosted on or linked to the Products, Services, and Network, you should look to the privacy policy and any terms those third parties or dApps. We do not control third-party apps and are not responsible for how they may treat your Personal Information.**

## WHAT WE COLLECT

When you visit our Sites or use our Products, Services, and Network, we may collect information that could identify you directly or indirectly (“**Personal Information**”). Personal Information does not include publicly available information or any data that has been deidentified, aggregated, or otherwise anonymized.
We only collect the minimum information needed to provide the Products, Services, and Network including:

- **Identifying Information.** To enable you to use our Products, Services, and Network, control your data, and send and receive information, we may collect your public key or DID to identify you.
  Account Information.

You may also choose to enhance your profile with your name, photo, GitHub account, or other information.
