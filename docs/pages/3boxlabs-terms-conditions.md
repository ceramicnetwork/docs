## 7. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT COMPELS MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND PROVIDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**

**7.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, respectively, that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, respectively, and to any of our subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Products, Services, and Network these Terms.

**7.2 Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.** Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, should be sent to: 275 S 5th St, 15E, Brooklyn, NY 11211. After the Notice is received, you and 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If unable to resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. Any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

**7.3 Arbitration Rules.** Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“**ADR Provider**”). If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction, subject to the Limitations of Liability set out in Section 6. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

**7.4 Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.** If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

**7.5 Time Limits.** If you or 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

**7.6 Authority of Arbitrator.** If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID.

**7.7 Waiver of Jury Trial.** THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. If any litigation should arise between you and 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND 3BOX LABS, CERAMIC, IDX, AND SELF ID WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

**7.8 Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.** ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

**7.9 Confidentiality.** All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

**7.10 Small Claims Court.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID may bring an individual action in small claims court.

**7.11 Emergency Equitable Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.

**7.12 Survival of Arbitration Agreement.** This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID.

**7.13 Courts.** Where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts within Kings County, New York, for such purpose.

**7.14 Governing Law.** These Terms are to be interpreted and applied under New York state law without regards for the state’s conflicts of law policies.

## 9. ENTIRE TERMS

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the Products, Services, and Network. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to 3Box Labs, Ceramic, IDX, or Self.ID, is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. We may freely assign these Terms. These Terms shall be binding upon assignees.

## 10. CHANGES

These Terms are subject to occasional revision. If we make any material changes, we will take reasonable steps to notify you and change the Last Updated date above.
