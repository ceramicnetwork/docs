# **Available Ceramic nodes**
To build an application on Ceramic, you don't necessarily have to run your own node. The community provides a set of nodes that can be used for application testing and development. These nodes are periodically wiped, so don't depend on them for long-term data availability.

| Network | Implementation | Mode | URL | Host |
| ------- | -------------- | --- | ---- | --- |
| Mainnet | JS Ceramic | Read-only | https://gateway.ceramic.network | 3Box Labs |
| Clay testnet | JS Ceramic | Read-only | https://gateway-clay.ceramic.network | 3Box Labs |
| Clay testnet | JS Ceramic | Read/Write | https://ceramic-clay.3boxlabs.com | 3Box Labs |

> At the moment, all mainnet applications that wish to perform write transactions must run their own mainnet node. The community is working with commercial infrastructure providers to offer managed Ceramic nodes as a service. We will update this page when those become available.
