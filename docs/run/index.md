# **Run nodes**

---

Ceramic node operators are responsible for hosting the various [Ceramic networks](). Ceramic clients need to connect to nodes in order to access the network. 

## **Who needs to run a node?**

Applications developers can get started building by [launching a local node]() or by connecting their clients to one of the [nodes hosted by community members](), but before moving to production you will need to run a node for your application.

> We're working with commercial node provides to offer production Ceramic nodes-as-a-service. We will update this page as those become available.

## **Launching a node**

---

### [**Run Ceramic locally →**]()
