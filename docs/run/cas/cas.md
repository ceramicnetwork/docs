# Hosting an anchor service

This guide describes how to spin up and run a hosted [Ceramic Anchor Service (CAS)](../../learn/glossary.md#anchor-service) in JavaScript that generates [anchor commits](../../learn/glossary.md#anchor-commit) for streams in batches. You can find the JavaScript CAS implementation [here](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/ceramic-anchor-service){:target="\_blank"}.

!!! warning ""

    It is currently not possible to run your own CAS. By default, every Ceramic node automatically uses a free [community-operated CAS](./community-cas.md). You do not need any additional setup. In the future, nodes will be able to specify which CAS they use. Once that is enabled, documentation will be added to this page.
