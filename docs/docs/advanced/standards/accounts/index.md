# Account standards

## Introduction

---

One of the many Ethereum development standards focus on token interfaces. These standards help ensure smart contracts remain composable, so for instance when a new project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized exchanges.

## Prerequisites

---

- Ethereum development standards
- Streams and stream programs

## Stream program standards

Here are some of the most popular stream program standards on Ceramic:

| CIP | NAME | DESCRIPTION |
| ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| CIP-79 | 3ID DID | A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies. |
| N/A | PKH DID | A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies. |
| N/A | KEY DID | A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies. |
