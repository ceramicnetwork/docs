# Ceramic Development Standards

## Standards Overview

---

The Ethereum community has adopted many standards that help keep projects (such as Ethereum clients and wallets) interoperable across implementations, and ensure smart contracts and dapps remain composable.

Typically standards are introduced as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), which are discussed by community members through a standard process.

## Types of standards

Certain EIPs relate to application-level standards (e.g. a standard smart-contract format), which are introduced as Ethereum Requests for Comment (ERC). Many ERCs are critical standards used widely across the Ethereum ecosystem.
