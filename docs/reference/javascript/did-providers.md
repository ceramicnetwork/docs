# DID Providers
A DID Provider is a library that exposes a json-rpc interface which is consumed by a Ceramic client or other DID compatible software. Usually it is constructed using a *seed* that the user controls. See the [Authentication](../../build/authentication.md) page for details on how to use DID providers.

## 3ID DID Provider
