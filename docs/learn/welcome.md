!!! warning "**MAINNET NOW LIVE!**"

    We're onboarding the first projects to [Mainnet](./mainnet.md) from the waitlist. If you want to deploy to mainnet in the near future, **[sign up for the Mainnet waitlist](https://blog.ceramic.network/ceramic-mainnet-early-launch-program/)**.

    While on the waitlist, you can always develop and prototype your integration on the [Clay Testnet](./networks.md#mainnet). Demonstrating a fully-functioning integration that is ready for mainnet is a great way to increase your odds of being selected from the waitlist. If you have questions or need further prioritization, you can [**join the Discord**](https://chat.ceramic.network) and let us know.

Ceramic is a decentralized, open source platform for creating, hosting, and sharing streams of data. With Ceramic's permissionless data streaming network, you can store streams of information and ever-changing files directly on the decentralized web – and share updates with anyone in the world.

Whether you want to learn how the Ceramic protocol works, explore standards and tooling, or get started building – this site has the resources for you.
