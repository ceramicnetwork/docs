# **The Ceramic network**

---

### **Ceramic is a decentralized network for composable data.**

With Ceramic, building scalable Web3 applications with natively-composable data is as easy as browsing a marketplace of community-created data models and plugging them into your app via open APIs for storing, updating, and retrieving data from those models. When different applications reuse the same data model, their underlying data is automatically interoperable.

By decentralizing the database layer for applications, Ceramic makes it possible data to be accessible and reusable across all applications built on the network.

## **Getting started**

---

### **Build applications with Ceramic**

Connect your app to Ceramic using a [**development framework**](../../tools/self-id/overview/) or [**client library**](../../reference/core-clients/ceramic-http/).

> Frameworks provide a great way to get started quickly, while clients provide greater flexibility but require a lower-level understanding of how the network functions.

### **Operate the Ceramic network**

Provide storage, compute, and bandwidth to the network by [**running a node**](../run/nodes/nodes.md).

> Today there are no tokenized incentives for running a Ceramic node, but by running a node you can ensure the data for your app remains available while helping contribute to the network's decentralization.
