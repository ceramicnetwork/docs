# **The Ceramic network**

---

### **Ceramic is a decentralized network for composable data.**

Ceramic makes building applications with composable Web3 data as easy as browsing a marketplace of data models, plugging them into your app, and storing, updating, and retrieving data from those models. When different applications reuse the same data models, their data is automatically interoperable. By decentralizing application databases, Ceramic makes data composable and reusable across all applications.

## **Getting started**

---

### **Build applications with Ceramic**

Connect your app to Ceramic using a [**development framework**](../build/frameworks/index.md) or [**client library**](../build/clients/index.md).

> Frameworks provide a great way to get started quickly, while clients provide greater flexibility but require a lower-level understanding of how the network functions.

    Don't know what to build with composable data? Check out these [data models](../docs/advanced/standards/data-models/index.md) to get your creativity flowing.

### **Operate the Ceramic network**

Provide storage, compute, and bandwidth to the network by [**running a node**](../run/index.md).

> Today there are no tokenized incentives for running a Ceramic node, but by running a node you can ensure the data for your app remains available while helping contribute to the network's decentralization.
