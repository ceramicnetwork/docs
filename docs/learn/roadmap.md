# **Roadmap**
---
We strive to be transparent with our developer community regarding where the project is heading. Sharing our product roadmap is our way to keep our community up-to-date with what things the core Ceramic team is currently working on, and what things we are planning for the future.

You can find the Ceramic roadmap [here](https://threebox.notion.site/Ceramic-Roadmap-98c5414dbba245a3835cf7ea98b883d3).

We do our best to keep this roadmap up-to-date and inform the community about the status of specific projects.
