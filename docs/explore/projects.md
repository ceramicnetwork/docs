# Community projects

This page contains a list of community projects built on Ceramic.

## **Featured projects**

### Boardroom (coming soon)

**Governance forums**: [BoardRoom](https://boardroom.info) uses Ceramic, [account-based stream indexing](../docs/advanced/standards/application-protocols/cip11-identity-index.md), and [3ID Connect](../docs/advanced/standards/accounts/cip79-3id-did.md#3id-connect) to store proposals, comments, votes, and other user-generated content for their decentralized governance application.

### GeoWeb

**Mutable files for NFTs**: [GeoWeb](https://geoweb.network) is creating a fair and open augmented reality (AR) metaverse where digital land is represented by NFTs and content for the land is represented by one or more streams on Ceramic.

> Learn more about GeoWeb and how they're using Ceramic in the [GeoWeb Spotlight](https://blog.ceramic.network/geo-web-is-connecting-digital-content-to-the-physical-world-with-nfts-and-ceramic/).

### MetaGame (coming soon)

**Multi-app user profiles**: [MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf) uses Ceramic, [account-based stream indexing](../docs/advanced/standards/application-protocols/cip11-identity-index.md), and [3ID Connect](../docs/advanced/standards/accounts/cip79-3id-did.md#3id-connect) to store profile data for Ethereum users that can be consumed, added to, or extended by any app in the Web3 metaverse.

### ArcX (coming soon)

**Decentralized document database**: [ArcX](https://arcx.game) uses Ceramic to store mutable JSON documents, similar to a NoSQL document store.

### Daemon.Land (coming soon)

**Multi-app data**: Developers on the [Daemon.Land](https://daemon.land) platform use Ceramic and [account-based stream indexing](../docs/advanced/standards/application-protocols/cip11-identity-index.md) to store user data, which makes it easy for users and their data to freely travel between different apps built with Daemon.Land.

### RabbitHole (coming soon)

**Cross-chain identity and reputation**: [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg) uses Ceramic, [account-based stream indexing](../docs/advanced/standards/application-protocols/cip11-identity-index.md), and [3ID Connect](../docs/advanced/standards/accounts/cip79-3id-did.md#3id-connect) to link multiple Web3 wallets and Web2 accounts to a unified, cross-chain DID. After calculating an aggregate reputation score for this DID, they issue and store a verifiable credential in the user's account-based index so it's usable on any other Web3 application.

### The Convo Space (coming soon)

### DNS.XYZ (coming soon)

**Web3 profiles**: [DNS.XYZ](https://dns.xyz) uses Ceramic and [account-based stream indexing](../docs/advanced/standards/application-protocols/cip11-identity-index.md) to allow users to create and manage a universal multi-account profile for the Web3 metaverse.

### FungyProof (coming soon)

**NFT grading and enrichments**: [FungyProof](https://fungyproof.com) uses Ceramic to store a cross-chain, aggregate view of NFTs and their associated data including: grade/quality, digital cases, events/press, achievements, and more. NFT Owners can improve their NFTs by adding enrichments and modify the NFTs public profile to highlight the characteristics they choose.
