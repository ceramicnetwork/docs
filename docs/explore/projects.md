# Community projects
This page contains a list of community projects built on Ceramic.

## Featured projects

### Boardroom (coming soon)
**Governance forums**: [BoardRoom](https://boardroom.info) uses Ceramic, [IDX](../tools/identity/idx.md), and [3ID Connect](../authentication/wallets/3id-connect.md) to store proposals, comments, votes, and other user-generated content for their decentralized governance application.

### GeoWeb
**Mutable files for NFTs**: [GeoWeb](https://geoweb.network) is creating a fair and open augmented reality (AR) metaverse where digital land is represented by NFTs and content for the land is represented by one or more streams on Ceramic. Learn more about GeoWeb and how they're using Ceramic in the [GeoWeb Spotlight](https://blog.ceramic.network/geo-web-is-connecting-digital-content-to-the-physical-world-with-nfts-and-ceramic/).

### MetaGame (coming soon)
**Multi-app user profiles**: [MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf) uses Ceramic, [IDX](../tools/identity/idx.md), and [3ID Connect](../authentication/wallets/3id-connect.md) to store profile data for Ethereum users that can be consumed, added to, or extended by any app in the Web3 metaverse.

### ArcX (coming soon)
**Decentralized document database**: [ArcX](https://arcx.game) uses Ceramic to store mutable JSON documents, similar to a NoSQL document store.

### Daemon.Land (coming soon)
**Multi-app data**: Developers on the [Daemon.Land](https://daemon.land) platform use Ceramic and [IDX](../tools/identity/idx.md) to store user data, which makes it easy for users and their data to freely travel between different apps built with Daemon.Land.

### RabbitHole (coming soon)
**Cross-chain identity and reputation**: [RabbitHole](https://rabbithole.gg) uses Ceramic, [IDX](../tools/identity/idx.md), and [3ID Connect](../authentication/wallets/3id-connect.md) to link multiple Web3 wallets and Web2 accounts to a unified, cross-chain DID. After calculating an aggregate reputation score for this DID, they issue and store a verifiable credential in the user's IDX so it's usable on any other Web3 application.
