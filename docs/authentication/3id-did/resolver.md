# 3ID DID Resolver

The 3ID DID Resolver is a [DID resolver](../../learn/glossary.md#did-resolver) for the [3ID DID Method](./method.md).

## Usage

When using the 3ID DID Method for [authentication](../../build/javascript/authentication.md) in your project, the 3ID DID Resolver must be imported during [installation](../../build/javascript/installation.md).

## Resources

You can find the source code for the JavaScript implementation of the 3ID DID Resolver at [`ceramicnetwork/3id-did-resolver`](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic/tree/develop/packages/3id-did-resolver){:target="\_blank"}. It works as a plugin to the core [`decentralized-identity/did-resolver`](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver){:target="\_blank"} package maintained by the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), which is included in all Ceramic implementations.
