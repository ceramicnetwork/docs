# Tools

Various tools such as libraries, CLIs and services are created on top of Ceramic to provide abstractions and specific solutions to some common use-cases.

## Glaze

The Glaze umbrella includes projects providing **low-level solutions** on top of Ceramic. Each project focuses on a specific scope, using a restricted number of dependencies on top of Ceramic.

## Self.ID

Self.ID is both a **reference application** and a **SDK** providing higher-level abstractions to create user-centric Web applications. It leverages Glaze projects and [DID Session](../reference/accounts/did-session.md) to offer a simple way to help Web developers get started with the Ceramic ecosystem.
