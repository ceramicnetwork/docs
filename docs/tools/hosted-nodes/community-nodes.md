!!! warning ""

    **Warning: These nodes will be periodically wiped and streams may disappear, so please don't rely on them for long-term persistence and availability of data**. If you need longer-term persistence, consider [hosting your own node](../../run/nodes/nodes.md). Also note that streams created on the [Clay Testnet](../../learn/networks.md#clay-testnet) will not be accessible on [Mainnet](../../learn/networks.md#mainnet). Only use Mainnet nodes for production deployments.
