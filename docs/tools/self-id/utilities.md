### [**Image utilities →**]()

The `@self.id/image-utils` module provides various utility functions for managing images on Web3 and is mostly meant to be used in a Web browser environment:

- **Multi-sizing** – Automatically convert an image into multiple sizes
- **IPFS upload** – Upload all image sizes to IPFS as a linked data structure
- **Smart selection** – Retrieve the most suitable image size based on your use case. For example, you might want to load profile image thumnails for a social UI or leaderboard, and load a larger resolution image for a single user profile page.
