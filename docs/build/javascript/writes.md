# Writes

Writes are interactions that write to streams, such as creating new streams or updating existing streams. You need an [installed client](./installation.md) and an [authenticated user](./authentication.md) to perform writes.

## **Usage**
Write operations are StreamType specific. The APIs for performing writes are contained within the various Stream implementations. See [StreamTypes](../../streamtypes/overview) for information on how to perform writes for each of the supported StreamTypes.
