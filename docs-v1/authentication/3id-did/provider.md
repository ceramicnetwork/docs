# 3ID DID Provider

3ID DID Provider is a low-level JavaScript library that provides interfaces for creating and authenticating 3IDs. For most applications seeking a more complete and user-friendly 3ID DID Provider, it is recommended that you instead use a higher-level library, such as [3ID Connect](./3id-connect.md).

## **Installation**

Before installing 3ID DID Provider, you must have [installed a Ceramic client](../../build/javascript/installation.md). By following the steps below, users will be able to [perform writes](../../build/javascript/writes.md) on Ceramic using a 3ID DID.

### 1. Install from npm

```sh
npm install 3id-did-provider
```

### 2. Import the 3ID Provider

```javascript
import ThreeIdProvider from '3id-did-provider'
```

### 3. Get a seed phrase

Generate a random seed for a new user, or somehow get the existing seed for a returning user. Seeds should be a 32 byte Uint8Array.

How to securely generate a new `seed` in the proper format:

```javascript
import { randomBytes } from '@stablelib/random'
const seed = randomBytes(32)
```

### 4. Create a 3ID Provider instance

#### Option 1: Using an external auth method (recommended)

This option enables one or more external `authSecrets` (seeds or private keys) to encrypt/decrypt the seed of the 3ID DID. It is useful, for example, if you want to control a 3ID DID using one or more blockchain wallets. This flow is what is implemented by [3ID Connect](./3id-connect.md).

```js
const authId = 'myAuthenticationMethod' // a name of the auth method

const threeId = await ThreeIdProvider.create({
  getPermission,
  authSecret,
  authId,
})

const provider = threeId.getDidProvider()
```

How to securely generate an `authSecret` in the proper format:

```javascript
import { randomBytes } from '@stablelib/random'
const authSecret = randomBytes(32)
```

How to use the `getPermission` parameter:

The `getPermission` parameter is always required when creating an instance of ThreeIdProvider. It allows your application to request actions from a 3ID, such as signing and/or decrypting data. When called, this function should prompt the user in the UI asking for permission to the given paths. You would likely need to implement a UI for this.

The function is called with one parameter which is the request object. It looks like this:

```js
{
    type: 'authenticate',
    origin: 'https://my.app.origin',
    payload: {
        paths: ['/path/1', '/path/2']
    }
}
```

In the above example the app with origin `https://my.app.origin` is requesting access to /path/1 and /path/2. If the user approves, the function should return the paths array. If they decline, it will return an empty array. Note that a user may approve only some of the requested paths, which would return an array containing only the approved paths.

The most simple `getPermission` function simply grants all requested permissions.

```javascript
const getPermission = async (request) => {
  return request.payload.paths
}
```

#### Option 2: Using only the 3ID's seed

```js
const threeId = await ThreeIdProvider.create({ getPermission, seed })
const provider = threeId.getDidProvider()
```

### 5. Set the 3ID Provider instance to Ceramic

Set the 3ID DID Provider instance to the DID instance used by your Ceramic client. You should have configured the DID instance when you [installed your client](../../build/javascript/installation.md).

```javascript
ceramic.did.setProvider(provider)
```

### 6. Authenticate the 3ID

Now all that's left is to authenticate to the Ceramic client's DID instance using the configured 3ID DID Provider.

```js
await ceramic.did.authenticate()
```

## **Next steps: Writes**

After authenticating with the 3ID DID Provider, users will now be able to perform [writes](../../build/javascript/writes.md).
