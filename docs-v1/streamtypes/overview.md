# StreamTypes

Each [stream](../learn/glossary.md#streams) on Ceramic must be created using a specific [StreamType](../learn/glossary.md#streamtypes). StreamTypes are programmable functions responsible for processing all updates to the stream and enforcing logic such as storage, consensus, and authentication. Different StreamTypes have different APIs for performing [writes](../build/javascript/writes.md), and some also have particular methods for performing reads. To perform operations on streams, see the API page for the respective StreamTypes below.

## **Default StreamTypes**

These StreamTypes are included in every Ceramic client and node implementation by default. Applications can make use of them without any additional work by simply using their APIs.

### TileDocument

TileDocuments are streams that store JSON content and support JSON schema validation. They can serve as JSON document stores for arbitrary application data.

### Caip10Link

Caip10Links are streams that store proofs which publicly link a blockchain account to a DID. They serve to link one or more Web3 accounts to a DID.

## **Custom StreamTypes**

It is possible to develop custom StreamTypes for use within your application. We will soon add a guide describing how this works.
